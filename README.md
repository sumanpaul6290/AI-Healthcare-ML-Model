📊 Data Classification Model
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning-based data classification model developed as part of my final year college project. The project focuses on designing and training a custom ML model to classify data based on defined features accurately.

🔍 Key Features
Custom-built machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model training, evaluation, and performance metrics

Well-structured and documented Jupyter Notebook

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

scikit-learn

pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn

📁 Project Structure
Data Classification Model.ipynb: Main notebook containing the complete workflow from data loading to model evaluation

👨‍💻 Contribution
Developed and implemented the machine learning model, including preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation as part of a collaborative final year project.
